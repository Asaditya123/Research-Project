Research Project - Sentiment Analysis of Dota 2 videogame chat in context of Cyber-bullying
In video gaming, emotion analysis can be used to better understand players and how they interact with the game. The focus of this suggestion is on the in-game conversation of Defense of the Ancient 2 (DOTA2), a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game aimed at combating cyberbullying. Positive and negative interaction is always present, but excessive negativity causes players to leave the game permanently. Sentiment Analysis when performed on the chat data can identify any instances of cyberbullying in DOTA 2. Normal sentimental analysis methods are inappropriate for the task due to the absence of specific words used primarily in the game to showcase negative emotions. Henceforth, an updated dictionary in line with DOTA 2 specific words is used for more accurate representation of the chat. A rating system is used as compared to a classifier to flag a chat as a negative or positive. The updated lexicon dictionary showed slight rise in performance across the evaluation parameters spectrum with 82% Accuracy, 0.73 Precision and 0.72 Recall. Highly negative logs can be reviewed by a human invigilator afterwards.
